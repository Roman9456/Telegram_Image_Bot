To install the required packages, follow these steps:

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website: python.org.

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended). Virtual environments help isolate Python dependencies for different projects. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory. Then run the following command to create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv myenv
This command will create a new virtual environment named "myenv".

Activate the virtual environment (if you created one). Activate the virtual environment by running the appropriate command for your operating system:

For Windows (Command Prompt):


myenv\Scripts\activate
For Windows (PowerShell):


myenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
For macOS/Linux:


source myenv/bin/activate
